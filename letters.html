  <h1>The Hidden Land(of turkeys)</h1>
  <p>THE HIDDEN LAND WAS A LAND THAT WAS HIDDEN. PEOPLE DID NOT KNOW IT WAS EVEN A THING UNTIL SOME RANDOM CHILDREN CaME IN A FOREST TO FIND MUSHROOMS TO POISON FOR NO REASON. WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING THEY SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEVER DISAPIER FROM THEIR MINDS EVER AGAIN. THEY FON A LAND OF DANCING TURKEYS!!! THEY RAN AWAY NEVER TO GO INTO THE FOREST OF THE HIDDEN LAND. BUT LITTLE DID THEY KNOW THOSE WERE NOT TURKEYS THEY WERE MUSHROOMS DRESSED AS TURKEYS. THE TURKEYS/MUSHROOMS DIED JUST A MOMENT LATER BECAUSE THEY JUST DID. LATER THAT DAY THE RANDOM, WIERD, CRAZY CHILDREN WENT TO JAIL ONLY BECAUSE THEY STOLE THE CHEESE THAT IS KNOWN FOR BEING GOD. YOU MIGHT BE THINKING "OH THEY WENT TO JAIL FOR CHEESENAPPING". NO. THEY ATE THE CHEESE GOS AND THE CHEESE GOD  N</p>
